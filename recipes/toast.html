        <h2>Tasty Avocado Toast</h2>
        <p>This is a very easy and yummy avocado toast recipe to start the day with lots of energy. It takes a bit more time in the kitchen than a bowl of cereal with milk but it'll keep you full way longer!</p>
        <p>In case you're not sure <strong>why</strong> you'd read this recipe of avocado toast, let me tell you that since I've made it for my partner and I one day, he's been asking me to make it every other day since!</p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong> <em>(for 2 people)</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
            <li>2 slices of toast (any kind)</li>
            <li>Lemon juice (can be replaced by anything else that's acidic)</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, paprika, chiliflakes (almost any spice)</li>
            <li></li>
            <li><em>Optional: fried eggs</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast your slices until golden brown, let it cool before putting on the plates (keeps the bread crispy).</li>
            <li>In the meantime, slice your avocado in half and remove the pit.</li>
            <li>Cute dices into the avocado, then use a fork to mash a bit before transfering to the toast.</li>
            <li>Spread the avocado on the toast, covering the entire surface of the toast.</li>
            <li>Add lemon juice to the toast, then salf, pepper and any other spice you like.</li>
            <li>Stop here and you'll have a delicious avocado toast to enjoy. Or fry up and egg and put in on top for extra protein.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This should get you full enough to last until the next meal! (And if not, you can always grab a snack <em>*wink*</em>.)</p>

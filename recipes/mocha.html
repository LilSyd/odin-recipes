        <h2>Homemade Mocha</h2>
        <p>This is my quick and easy recipe for a Mocha at home. It sweet, chocolatey with just the right amount of coffee.</p>
        <p>Making this sweet drink is especially easy if you already have a coffee machine at home but no worries, you can still make it with any other coffe making devide you have on hand. The key is to have a strong enough coffee that you don't mind using in a mix.</p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong> <em>(for 1 cup)</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100ml strong coffee (I use Stockholm by Nespresso)</li>
            <li>Condensed milk or sweetener of choice</li>
            <li>200ml milk of choice (I use oat milk)</li>
            <li>3 to 4 teaspoons of hot chocolate mix (Van Houten Bistro)</li>
            <li><em>Optional: whipcream</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a cup and cover the bottom in condensed milk or your choice of sweetener.</li>
            <li>Then pour warm coffee over it and mix really well.</li>
            <li>Warm up the milk to your desired temperature (I do 1.30min in the microwave).</li>
            <li>Add hot chocolate mix to the milk and mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the chocolate mixture over the coffee mixture and mix well.</li>
            <li>Top with whipcream fir extra sweetness and creaminess.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And here is your delicious warm mocha to enjoy in the comfort of your home!</p>
